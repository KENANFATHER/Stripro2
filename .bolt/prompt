Stripro is a micro-SaaS web app built with React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. It provides Stripe-powered businesses (SaaS, agencies, e-commerce) with clear, actionable client profitability analytics.
The app must always be:

Modern, responsive, and user-friendly

Secure (using Supabase Auth, including Google sign-in)

Consistent in branding (Stripro logo, slogan, and color scheme)

Modular, with a dashboard layout and sidebar navigation

All pages must have clear titles and placeholder sections for future content

Navigation must always work smoothly, with each menu item showing a dedicated page

Use Tailwind CSS for all styling

All features and pages must be accessible and mobile-friendly

Always respect these principles and context in every prompt for this project.
